This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to classify different types of galaxies based on their images. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between various galaxy shapes and configurations.

- Developing a galaxy classification model that recognizes various galaxy types with 90% accuracy
- Creating a user-friendly interface to increase astronomical understanding
- Ensure scalability and consistencywith Docker for efficient deployment
- Provide global availability by distributing the project on AWS EC2 for broad use

### Moon Shape Classification using YOLO and Roboflow

Developed a computer vision model using YOLO and Roboflow for moon shape classification.

- Handled a dataset of 1370 images with 8 classes.
- Implemented preprocessing techniques like auto-orient and resizing to 640x640 pixels.
- Enhanced dataset quality with augmentations: grayscale, saturation, brightness, exposure adjustments, blur, and noise.
- Calculated an F1 Score of approximately 81.0%, balancing precision and recall, signifying a robust model performance in moon shape classification.
