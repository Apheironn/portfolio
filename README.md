### Automated Component Segmentation in Production Lines

- Implemented a robust computer vision solution utilizing OpenCV to identify and segment 15 distinct components on a production line, ensuring high-precision part recognition and sorting.
- Developed an algorithm using the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detector to create descriptors for each component, coupled with a BFMatcher for accurate matching, allowing for real-time component identification.
- Successfully deployed the system to operate directly on the production line, demonstrating high accuracy in component separation, significantly optimizing the manufacturing process and reducing manual inspection workload.

### Moon Shape Classification using YOLO and Roboflow

Developed a computer vision model using YOLO and Roboflow for moon shape classification.

- Handled a dataset of 1370 images with 8 classes.
- Implemented preprocessing techniques like auto-orient and resizing to 640x640 pixels.
- Enhanced dataset quality with augmentations: grayscale, saturation, brightness, exposure adjustments, blur, and noise.
- Calculated an F1 Score of approximately 81.0%, balancing precision and recall, signifying a robust model performance in moon shape classification.

### Time Series Analysis for Markets

- The dataset includes information on products sold in different stores over a specific time period from January 1, 2015, to July 31, 2015.
- The primary objective of this analysis is to understand how promotions and other factors might influence sales in different stores and for various products. By studying the data, we aim to provide insights and recommendations that can help optimize promotion strategies and improve overall sales performance.
